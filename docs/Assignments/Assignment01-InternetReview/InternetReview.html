    <h1>Internet Review</h1>
    <p>
        The internet is a resource that is of immeasurable value in the modern age. Originally thought to be something of a niche that would see no popularized use or success, by even the 1990s, a major shift could be seen, and by the late 2010s, it's difficult to imagine life without it. With the multitude of services it provides, schools and most jobs require access to the internet, whether it be directly in their respective environments, or outside of them as well. Despite the immeasurable use the internet provides, there are many shortcomings still present even to this day. Unlimited access to a well of knowledge would seem like something that could hold no drawbacks, but with this wealth of information before us, there are always those who intent to lead astray, or find ways to attack us in one way or another. From fake news articles, to trolls sending crude messages into DMs, there are so many things that prevent the internet from attaining its full potential. Everyday, new communities are formed, creating echo-chambers in which incorrect facts or prejudice views are bounced back and forth between people until they are taken as truth.  In turn, outright lies can find themselves having an entire cast behind them, supporting whatever false information is presented, even having entire articles posted without any factual evidence to back them up, entirely due to a small community taking opinions as fact. With this in mind, I can only bring myself to give the internet a 7 out of 10. If the internet were a college student, it definitely passed the class, but just barely.

                    This is the second iteration of the first quest for the IP Project: Steampunk. The first draft was reviewed by other team members, and we determined that a character should be introduced earlier in the story. This was done to ensure players know him before his later reappearance, to create more of a connection with the character before the events of the story unfolded.

                    This was a game created using a software that was new to me at the time, Twine. The game is a text based adventure game. This title, being text based, tended to have longer paragraphs in it, which were broken up using timer delays to make digestable portions, per player feedback during playtesting.

                    Forking Paths Remake
                </h3>
                <p class="imageBottomText">
                    This is a remake to the forking paths text game. This game is a title using the bitsy engine, one with heavy limitations to work around. With the present barriers presented, I changed the story to fit better within the given medium.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A major improvement I wish I could make is the ability to mark people you've spoken with in game after the dialogue is complete, but bitsy limits animation to two frames and they play automatically.
